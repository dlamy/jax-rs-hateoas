## Intro
JAX-RS-HATEOAS is a small extension to JAX-RS to enable hypermedia in JAX-RS 1.x applications.

Adding hypermedia to your existing application is easily done in four steps:

* Extend HateoasApplication (or JerseyHateoasApplication)
* Add @Linkable annotations to all methods that should be linkable.
* Use HateoasResponse instead for building responses with HATEOAS links.  The normal Response methods (ok, created, entity, etc.) will now return a HateoasResponseBuilder.
* Use the HateoasResponseBuilder contains methods to easily add links to your responses:
	* link(String linkId, String rel, Object... params) - adds a link to the referenced linkId (as defined by an @Linkable annotation).
	* selfLink(String linkId, Object... params) - adds a link to the referenced linkId with a 'self' rel
   (rather than the default rel defined in the referenced @Linkable annotation
	* ...etc
	
## Configuring Link Structure

Beginning in 0.5.0, you can specify the link structure type while creating your HateoasApplication.  

### Rationale

By default, links are formatted as a JSON array:

        {
          "links":
            [
              {
                 "rel": "relName",
                 "href": "/path/to/resource",
                 "method": "GET"
              },
              {
                 "rel": "otherRel",
                 "href": "/path/to/other/resource",
                 "method": "GET"
              }
            ]
        }

The array structure requires the client to iterate over the links in order to find the desired rel, which has performance and general PIA implications.

0.5.0 adds the ability to specify a map-based link structure instead.  Map structures look like this:

        {
          "links":
            {
              "relName": 
                {
                  "href": "/path/to/resource",
                  "method": "GET"
                },
              "otherRel": 
                {
                  "href": "/path/to/other/resource",
                  "method": "GET"
                }
            }
        }

By making the rel name the map key, clients can much more easily and quickly obtain desired rels from the set.


### Configuration
A new property has been added to `HateoasConfigurationFactory` that allows you enable a Map-based link structure instead of the standard Array-based structure.  Specify this property value as "true" during HateoasApplication construction to enable:

	ImmutableMap.<String, Object>builder()
		...
		.put(HateoasConfigurationFactory.PROPERTY_HATEOAS_MAP_STRUCTURE_ENABLED, "true")
		.build()
